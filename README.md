## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say _"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"_
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say _"Please provide a valid email address"_

- Flexbox
- Vanilla JS

### What I learned

This Challenge allowed me to learn basic Javascript Form Validation

### Continued development

I hope to elarn more about Javacript Form Validation and also Regular Expression

### Useful resources

- [Brad Travery 20 Web Projects With Vanilla JavaScript](https://www.udemy.com/course/web-projects-with-vanilla-javascript/) - The Form Validator project in the course help me understand form validation and how to use Regular Expression to check if an email is valid
- [Florin Pop ping-coming-soon-page-master ](https://github.com/florinpop17/frontend-mentor-challenges/tree/master/ping-coming-soon-page-master) - This is an amazing repo which allowed me to compelte this challenge. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning Form Validation.
